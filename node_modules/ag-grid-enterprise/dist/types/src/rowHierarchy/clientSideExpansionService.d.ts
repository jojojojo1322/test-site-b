     * CSRM has updated.
     *
     * if we did not do this, then the user could call setExpanded on 100+ rows, causing the grid
     * to re-render 100+ times, which would be a performance lag.
     *
     * we use animationFrameService
     * rather than debounce() so this will get done if anyone flushes the animationFrameService
     * (eg user calls api.ensureRowVisible(), which in turn flushes ).
